AS the world watched Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton tear
each other in the most polarised presidential election in the history of the
U.S elections, several predictions circulated online that forecast a positive
outcome for Trump.  However, a  Nigerian
prophet TB Joshua of the Synagogue Church of nations (SCOAN) dismissed such
forecasts as outdated, claiming that he had been ‘shown’ a Clinton victory.  "Ten days ago, I saw the new President of America  [Clinton] with a narrow win," he said last
Sunday.   "…the men of God that said [the] opposite [Trump victory] –
maybe they saw it 15 days ago."    TB Joshua went on to ‘reveal’ that two states would be
instrumental in Clinton's ‘victory’ at the polls.  He said the new president would be visited by many
challenges, including attempts to possibly pass a "vote of no
confidence" amidst difficulties in the passing of bills. "The boat of the new president will be rocked," TB
Joshua 'prophesied'.  "I want to salute the opposition – a very strong man
and courageous. He is my friend because he is very, very courageous,” he said.  “Challenges don't mean anything to him. The more they abuse
him, the more he comes out to talk and smile."  However, as you already know, Trump caused a stunning upset.  He has so far claimed 289 electoral votes compared with Clinton's 218.  A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to be declared President elect.  This is so embarrassing for someone who chided those who ‘saw’
a Trump victory for pushing outdated divinations.  The BBC reported that TB Joshua had since removed the prediction of a Clinton victory from his Facebook account.  However, he doesn't know that there is something called the long memory of the Internet.

Its quite avowed that he is not brave enough to admit this blind prophecy.    However, he doesn't know that there is something called the long memory of the Internet.
